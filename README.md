# Image_segmentation_PASTIS
PASTIS dataset time series image segmentation

slides.pdf contains a summary of tasks done and model comparision of UNet3d and UTAEs.

Python files with .py extensions are helper files only for testing the performance of pretrained UTAEs in pastis-utae-test.ipynb.

Pretrained weights for panoptic UTAEs can be found here: (https://zenodo.org/records/5172301)
Pretrained weights for semantic UTAEs can be found here: (https://zenodo.org/records/5172293)

Most of the implementation is from: (https://github.com/VSainteuf/utae-paps/tree/main)
